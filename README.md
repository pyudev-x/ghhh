# Cool Java program!

## Install instructions

Download the repository zip open the directory where it downloaded
and open out/artifacts/ghhh_jar then open the jar file. You will probably need
the JDK and JRE installed.

## What the program does

It spawns multiple colored windows until your computer runs out of memory!
You can ALT-F4 and CMD-Q this program luckily.
